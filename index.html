        <h2> &nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</h2>

Established with a vision to inspire meaningful action toward mitigating climate change, our organization serves as a beacon of hope for a greener and more sustainable Kenya.

        <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Mission: Why We Were Formed</h2>
        <p>Our main objective is to empower young people through Agriculture by providing quality chicks and impacting skills to the teens on how to conserve the environment by providing quality seedlings; that is to ensure that they know how to nurture a tree from its seedling state to maturity. Our formation was motivated by the urgent need to address the growing environmental challenges and food insecurity exacerbated by climate change. Recognizing the untapped potential of youth to contribute meaningfully to these causes, we aim to empower them through education, resources, and hands-on initiatives. By nurturing a generation of environmentally conscious and agriculturally skilled individuals, we aspire to build a resilient society prepared to tackle the climate crisis head-on.</p>
